First, update your distro

	$ sudo apt-get update
	$ sudo apt-get upgrade

For the "Kinetic" distro, follow the instructions here: 

	http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu

If not already done as part of the kinetic install instructions, add "source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash"
to your .bashrc file.

If necessary, install extra packages:

	$ sudo apt-get install -y python-rosdep python-rosinstall-generator python-wstool python-rosinstall build-essential cmake


Create a ros workspace for building the AVC ros pacakges.

	$ mkdir -p ~/ros_catkin_ws
	$ cd ~/ros_catkin_ws
	$ catkin_make
	$ source devel/setup.bash

	Be sure to add "source ~/ros_catkin_ws/develop/setup.bash to .bashrc
	It is ok to have your environment source the workspace after already
	sourcing the kinetic installation; otherwise, ros won't be able to
	find avc packages that need to be built.

Go to src/ros_package, and run setup.sh. This will copy the necessary avc files to the ros workspace.

Build the AVC ros packages. Go to your ros workspace home, and enter 'catkin_make'.
